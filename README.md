### Instructional tasks

To help you finish the final project, we have provided a list of instructional tasks to guide you:

1. Create a new GitHub repository called agile-final-project and ensure it is public.
2. Create a Project in your GitHub repository and name it Final Project.
3. Create an issue template for the new repository similar to the labs.
4. Create issues for the stakeholder requirements listed above (10 in total). Fill in the As a… I need… So that… section of the template.
5. Move requirements 7 and 8 issues into the Icebox.
6. Move the remaining issues into the Product Backlog.
7. Conduct a Backlog Refinement meeting and rank the Product Backlog to match the requirements order.
8. Update the top 5 stories in the Product Backlog with acceptance criteria following the Gherkin Given… When… Then… syntax.
9. Create a technical debt label.
10. Add labels of either enhancement or technical debt to all stories in the Product Backlog.
11. Create a sprint milestone with a duration of 2 weeks, named Sprint.
12. Conduct a Sprint Planning meeting. Add the top 4 stories to the sprint, assign them to the sprint milestone, and assign story point estimates. Move these 4 stories to the Sprint Backlog.
13. Simulate a sprint by assigning the top story to yourself. Move it to the In Progress column.
14. Move the story to Review/QA. Take the next story from the Sprint Backlog, assign it to yourself, and move it to the In Progress column.
15. Move the story in Review/QA to Done. Move the story from In Progress to Review/QA. Take the next story off the Sprint Backlog, assign it to yourself, and move it to the In Progress column.
16. Move the story in Review/QA to Done. Leave the story in the In Progress column where it is. This marks the end of the sprint.
